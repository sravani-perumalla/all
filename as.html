    He was an Indian revolutionary involved in the Indian independence movement.
He was born in present-day Andhra Pradesh in 1897 or 1898.
He became a sanyasi at the age of 18, and gained a mystical aura among the hill and tribal peoples with his austerity, knowledge of astrology and medicine, and his ability to tame wild animals.
Freedom Movement:
At a very young age, Raju channelled the discontent of the hill people in Ganjam, Visakhapatnam, and Godavari into a highly effective guerrilla resistance against the British.
Guerrilla warfare is a form of irregular warfare in which small groups of combatants use military tactics including ambushes, sabotage, raids, petty warfare, hit-and-run tactics, and mobility, to fight a larger and less-mobile traditional military.Colonial rule threatened the tribals’ traditional podu (shifting) cultivation, as the government sought to secure forest lands.
He became involved in anti-British activities in response to the 1882 Madras Forest Act, which effectively restricted the free movement of Adivasis (tribal communities) in their forest habitats and prevented them from practicing a traditional form of agriculture known as podu (shifting cultivation).
Rising discontent towards the British led to the Rampa Rebellion/Manyam Rebellion of 1922, in which he played a major part as a leader.
The Rampa Rebellion coincided with Mahatma Gandhi’s Non-Cooperation Movement. He persuaded people to wear khadi and give up drinking.
But at the same time, he asserted that India could be liberated only by the use of force, not non-violence.
He was nicknamed "Manyam Veerudu" (Hero of the Jungle) by local villagers for his heroic exploits.
In 1924, Raju was taken into police custody, tied to a tree, and shot by a public execution, effectively ending the armed rebellion.Harnessing widespread discontent towards the British colonial rule in the backdrop of the non-cooperation movement, Alluri led his forces against the British, aiming to expel them from the Eastern Ghats region through his guerilla campaigns. During this period, he led numerous raids on local police stations to acquire firearms for his under-equipped forces. After each raid, he would leave behind a letter written by him, informing the police about the details of his raids, including about the weaponry he parted away with, daring them to stop him if they can. Police stations in and around the areas of Annavaram, Addateegala, Chintapalle, Dammanapalli, Krishna Devi Peta, Rampachodavaram, Rajavommangi, and Narsipatnam were all targeted by his forces in the raids which also saw significant police casualties. In response to these raids, and in order to quell the rebellion, the British colonial authorities undertook a nearly two-year long manhunt for him, resulting in expenditures reaching over ₹40 Lakh rupees then. Eventually, in 1924, he was trapped by the British at the village of Koyyuru in the Chintapalle forests. There, he was captured, tied to a tree and summarily executed by a firing squad. His resting place currently lies in the village of Krishnadevipeta.Indicative of his future as a leader, Alluri in his high school days was often found riding his uncle's horses to distant hilly places, and familiarising himself with the various problems being faced by different tribes, who were then living under British colonial rule. He was particularly moved by seeing the hardships of the Koyas, people of a hill tribe. Fond of pilgrimage, in 1921 he visited Gangotri and Nasik, birthplaces of the holy rivers, Ganga and Godavari. During his travels in the country, he met revolutionaries in Chittagong, on seeing the socio-economic conditions of people, particularly those of the tribals, he was severely appalled and decided to build a movement for their independence from British rule. He then settled down in the Papi hills near Godavari District, an area with a high density of tribal populations.[14][15][16]

Sitarama Raju initially practiced various spiritual disciplines to gain moral stature and spiritual power. During this time, the efforts of Christian missionaries to gain converts by any means amongst the hill tribes annoyed him, as he saw it as a tool to perpetuate imperialism. He continued living an austere life, with bare minimum needs amongst the tribal people. Taking only items like fruits and honey from them, he would return much of everything offered to him, with his blessings. Very soon his charismatic nature gained him a reputation among the tribals of being someone possessed with holy powers, even a messianic status, a reputation that was bolstered both by myths he created about himself, and by his acceptance of ones about him that were established by others, including those concerning his reputed invincibility.[17][10]

Noting the grievances of the tribals, and finding solutions to their problems, he started to organise and educate them about their rights, and prepared them for a fight against the oppression and tyranny of the forest and revenue officials, missionaries and police. Touring the forest terrains, he gained extensive knowledge of the geographical features, which helped him in his future as a guerrilla warfare tactician. Around this time, when the British authorities confiscated their ancestral properties, the Koya tribal brothers, Mallam Dora and Ghantam Dora, who were freedom fighters, joined the ranks of Rama Raju and became his lieutenants. As the oppressive practices of the British continued to become unbearable, and rebellion became the last option for people to live free, Rama Raju became their natural leader. The Government then did try to win him over by offering 60 acres of fertile land for his ashram, but he rejected it and stood by the people.[18][15]
